1. Create master machine and install JDK and Jenkins
2. Create slave machine and install JDK (and any other tools like mvn which are required to run jobs)
3. Create ssh key on Master using ssh-keygen with either RSA or ed25519 algorithm 
4. Copy public from master to slave (/home/<user>/.ssh/authotized_keys)
5. Test ssh connectivity from master to slave (ssh <user>@slave)
6. The above step will add slave's signature in master's current users home dir .ssh/known_hosts
7. Copy .ssh folder from master to /var/lib/jenkins on master
8. Change ownership of above folder to jenkins user (chown -R jenkins /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh)
9. Go to jenkins dashboard nodes and clouds and add a new node
10. Choose remote dir as /home/<user>
11. Enter username as <user> and password as private key from master
